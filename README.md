# JSB

**JSB** (or **Java Shrimp Bot**) is a Discord bot using [jwiki](https://github.com/fastily/jwiki) to integrate with MediaWiki. It is full of tasty java and scrumptious shrimp!

This is used to manage [User:ShrimpBot](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/User:ShrimpBot) on the [FTB Wiki](https://ftb.gamepedia.com).
It uses a modular command system to allow the user to execute commands in Discord. Check out the FTB Discord (find it on the FTB Wiki sidebar) to test it out!
The jwiki library used is still in development but not actively updated. I might PR stuff in later.
