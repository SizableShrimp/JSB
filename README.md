# JSB

**JSB** (or **Java Shrimp Bot**) is a bot using [jwiki](https://github.com/fastily/jwiki) to integrate with MediaWiki. It is full of tasty java and scrumptious shrimp!

This is used to manage [User:Sizableshrimp2](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/User:Sizableshrimp2) on the [FTB Wiki](https://ftb.gamepedia.com).
It uses a modular command system to allow the user to execute commands, like one would in a kernel.
The jwiki library used is still in development but not actively updated. I might PR stuff in later.

## To-Do
* Make this bot integrate with Discord. ([Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J)?)
* Add more shrimp. 🦐🦐🦐
* Drink more coffee. ☕☕☕
